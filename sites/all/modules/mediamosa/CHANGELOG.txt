- Allowing to use order_by and order_direction in combination with CQL (without
  using sortby in CQL). You can not specify order_by and CQL sortby, this will
  still return a error.

  to included schema.xml in mediamosa_solr dir. Also restart Solr and reindex
  the solr index on /admin/mediamosa/config/solr/indexer.

  documentation, causing developer tool not to work.
- Fixed still REST calls; Generated stills where not returned on images because
  their size did not match default. Will now return stills that are inside
  default size and have one side the same size. This happens when image ratio
  does not match default still size and generates a still that fits the default,
  but is not in ratio with default still size.
- Fixed timezone unit test to ignore /asset/deleted REST calls in its tests.
- Added drupal_alter to the asset title function for backend asset browser.

  to cause problems. Fixed by using POST instead of GET for Solr queries.
  Solr API needs fixing to use fopen calls instead of file_contents calls.
  Maybe time for Drupal 7 version of the API instead of the Google code
  version with some good unittesting on the code?
  Although I'm not sure its the API or Solr thats has the problem with GET

  In case where a fresh install and the configuration was still untouched, then
  the master switch was 'on' instead of default 'off'.
- Fixed internal calls during Simpletest; internal REST calls where not made
  inside the scope of the simpletest, resulting the REST call inside the
  simpletest ending up on the normal database, outside the simpletest. Although
  it had no serious effect (internal password would never match), but a warning
  would have been produced in the watchdog on the normal database about internal
  REST call having an invalid internal password.

  selection.
- In profile; Removed all TEXT boxes with settings and replaced them with
  <pre></pre> making all settings show during profile to be the same format.

  not supplied.
- Fixed: The combination URL and URI in mediafile check when IS_DOWNLOADABLE was
  set to any value in mediafile/create resulted in unnessary exception.
- Added transactions into metadata save and deletion of asset. Although we need
  a more extended transaction support on REST calls; rolling back everything
  during the REST call. This is very tricky; What do we do with any output
  already generated? Watchdog entries will be rolled back too. Need some more
  thinking for the global transaction support.

---------------------------
- Default still image size is now 352x288, with no maintain aspect ratio (no
  padding).
- Job/id/status: start time is now stored as UTC date, so unixtimestamp is
  not out of sync (See ticket #321).
- fixed several Windows transcoding related issues.
- <content_type> on a playrequest for flash is now also 'application/smil'.
  (see ticket #323).

Other changes (not ticket related)

  correct uid/gid (dependend on the Proftpd version).
- Fix: orderby descending did not work when not using CQL.
- Transcoding support for underscore in parameters allowed (some windows encoder
  software use this)

- Fixed saving of empty values in drop down select boxes in transcode profile
  admin.
- Fixed problem saving transcode profile without revision saving.
- Drupal 7 does not allow case-sensitive schema creation, this caused problems
  migrating database with IDs. Fixed by adding varbinary type to schema creation
  code of mediamosa. All IDs that are varchar and have the 32 character length
  are now varbinary type.

  MediaMosa ticket #166).

Other changes (not ticket related)
- Play proxy call will now return the ticket id in result.
- Fixed number of query bugs in AUT / ACL code.
- Fixed job server where 2 rows where inserted while only one was allowed.
- Added unique index on mediamosa_job_server table to prevent multiple rows on
  same parent job.
- Added foreign key on mediamosa_job_server to mediamosa_job - job_id.
- Prevented possible divided by zero problems in job server.
- asset_id_root in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is now deprecated, will be
  removed in later versions.
- parent_id in mediamosa_asset table is now deprecated, will be removed in later
  versions.
- is_original_file boolean in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is deprecated, is
  replaced by mediafile_id_source.
- mediafile_id_source is now either NULL or points to its original mediafile.
- Fixed still generation call /mediafile/$mediafile/still.
- Fixed play_restriction code. Typo with 'time_restriction_' prevented working
  of this code in the play proxy code. Seems to be old bug dating back from 1.0.
- Added /version REST call.
- Empty metadata values is no longer allowed. This made the search query a bit
  faster.
- Statistics in 1.x falsely created new statistics based on what some unittest
  was testing. F.e. the CQL unit test would generate new stats based on the
  searches during test and store them as normal stats. This no longer is
  a bug because of the sandbox environment of 2.x unittests.
- Some ffmpeg versions give value 'N/A' for bitrate. This caused database errors
  when trying to insert. Fixed by converting all required numeric values to
  integers.
- Conversion of some queries where NULL was inserted into NON-NULL allowed
  values is creating problems in DP7 database. This is because the old D6 code
  unintentially forced NULL values to be empty strings. This behavor can not be
  replicated in D7. Decided to put those columns in the database to allow NULL
  values instead. Statistics as example had owner_id and group_id as non-null.
- Fixed /collection which had asset_id as required, which is only when the call
  was made as /asset/{asset_id}/collection.
- Removed field 'locked' from asset and asset output(s). Field was not
  documented or used.
- Header fields item_count_total and item_offset are always present in the
  header while in 1.x these only where found for multi item results. In case of
  single item results, then item_count_total will always be 1 and item_offset 0.
- mediafile output will include new mediafile_id_source which can hold the ID of
  the original mediafile. When empty, then the mediafile is a original.
- /asset/$asset_id/joblist [GET] will now return 705 (empty result) when no jobs
  where found, instead of result ID 601 (OK).
- /asset/$asset_id/metadata [POST] will now return 705 (empty result) when no
  metadata was added.
- /asset/$asset_id/still/create [POST] will now return the job_id in the
  items response when success. 1.x only returned a 601 success result ID.
- The 'limit' REST parameter, where used in REST calls, is no longer required in
  any REST call, its default is 200.
- Date types uses ISO8601 norm; 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'.
  Timezone specification in ISO8601 however is ignored for now. Its now allowed
  to enter '2007' or '2007-10' without triggering errors.
- Server IP/URL settings are now prepared/compliant for IPv7.
- MediaMosa is now UTF8 Compliant.
- asset/delete REST call now returns failures per failed asset and their cause.
- Fixed problems editing the transcode profile.
- Fixed migration problem on transcode profiles.
- REST call mediafile/$mediafile_id/uploadticket/create now also returns the
  ticket_id as separate value.
- Removed notices and warnings when mediafile's file on disk does not exists.
- Added new unit test listing under Browse tab.
- Added new development tool/module for testing REST calls.
