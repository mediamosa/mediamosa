MediaMosa 3.6.0-dev (build 2122)
--------------------------------
- Added MediaMosa viewer module, enabled multiple object code streaming
  definitions. Each app can now select other streaming viewer objects (when
  available).
- Fixed bug when selecting correct viewer object on streaming server.
- Added support for metadata field names in format of [context].[metadatafield]
  (dc.title) for Solr facet and related field parameters.
- Solr now correctly indexes with context set prefix.
- Add facet search for Solr (3.6).
- Extended search engine with related assets search for Solr.
- Change Solr schema to support related search, and now storing metadata in
  solr.
- Removed watchdog leftover code.
- Updated MediaMosa CK module to latest, please use git submodule update to
  retrieve changes.
- Allowing to use order_by and order_direction in combination with CQL (without
  using sortby in CQL). You can not specify order_by and CQL sortby, this will
  still return a error.
- Fixed problem with schema and facet search, please update your Solr schema.xml
  to included schema.xml in mediamosa_solr dir. Also restart Solr and reindex
  the solr index on /admin/mediamosa/config/solr/indexer.
- Fixed multiple fields when using solr facet search.

  interfaces and Drupal status page will report problems on the MediaMosa status
  page.

  assets. Test now fails on Solr, will be fixed in later build of module.
- Fixed; No related assets generated SQL error when counting viewed value.
- Extended REST output to include attributes on <item> tags.
- Added asset/deleted REST call, listing IDs of deleted assets.
- Added drush mm-meta-copy and mm-meta-update. Added 2 new drush functions to
  manipulate metadata of lots of assets in 1 run.
- Fixed dc.date field, type is char, not date.
- Fixing /rest output, did not properly output some fields in the REST call
  documentation, causing developer tool not to work.
- Fixed still REST calls; Generated stills where not returned on images because
  their size did not match default. Will now return stills that are inside
  default size and have one side the same size. This happens when image ratio
  does not match default still size and generates a still that fits the default,
  but is not in ratio with default still size.
- Fixed timezone unit test to ignore /asset/deleted REST calls in its tests.
- Added drupal_alter to the asset title function for backend asset browser.

  completely rebuild the index using page 'admin/mediamosa/config/solr/indexer'.
  Make sure you are using the 'mediamosa-3.5.4-asset' solr schema file or
  higher. Version can be viewed using the Solr admin or in schema.xml.

- Fixed bug in OAI listrecords.
- Added more asset info on the asset info page.
- Added stemming to Solr, support directly for Dutch in supplied Solr schema.
  Change language in solr schema when using stemming in your language. In CQL
  Specify /stem modifier to use stemming. For example dc.title =/stem "foo".
  Reindex and replacement of the Solr schema's is required.
- Fixed solr facetted search for asset_type.
- Fixed related search; now respects ACL rules and master-slave.
- Added boost modifier to CQL. Only Solr atm will use the parameter. Use as
  title =/boost=2 "something" in CQL.

  not return the correct results. MySQL ended in SQL exception, Solr returned
  wrong results.

  one client application was created.
- Removed status tests for Yamdi, MP4Box and Lav2yuv.

- Fixed file upload with transcoding parameters; current code only allowed
  transcode profiles from the same client application that uploaded the file.
- Fixed drupal alter call for asset enrich on output.
- Added trashcan and restore functionality for assets. This allows client
  application to keep deleted assets and restore them later back to its original
  state.
- Fixed: Job scheduler not starting transfer and storage jobs.
- Fixed: Mountpoint module; streamwrapper created incorrect path from uri.
- Fixed: Mountpoint module will no longer use the root location of an storage

- Fixed default value of the master switch for running automated simpletests.
  In case where a fresh install and the configuration was still untouched, then
  the master switch was 'on' instead of default 'off'.
- Fixed internal calls during Simpletest; internal REST calls where not made
  inside the scope of the simpletest, resulting the REST call inside the
  simpletest ending up on the normal database, outside the simpletest. Although
  it had no serious effect (internal password would never match), but a warning
  would have been produced in the watchdog on the normal database about internal
  REST call having an invalid internal password.
- Removed the usage of 'mediamosa_status_generate' and replaced it with normal
  functions with _ as prefix. Was not used as hooks anyway.
- Rewrote most logic used in the component and configuration page. Will now
  show more info when failure was found. Detection on installation of commands
  improved.
- Added Solr status page test.
- Added Solr configuration.
- Fixed some minor warnings we got from coder module.
- Removed mediamosa_asset_metadata::search_get_part_where() was no longer used.
- Added ignore_user_abort(TRUE) once REST call was successfully matched to
  ensure the REST call will be executed even when the connection is lost to the
  client. Always applies to POST/DELETE rest calls, internal CRON GET calls.
- Updated profile to only show the selected setup instead of both during
  selection.
- In profile; Removed all TEXT boxes with settings and replaced them with
  <pre></pre> making all settings show during profile to be the same format.
- Fixed: Added code that will restore the Drupal error handler when REST call
  was not matched.
- Status page extended with real time information.
- Added check for CRON being trigger on status page. Will turn red when CRON
  hasn't been triggered for 3 minutes.
- Added information about the drupal settings file on status page.
- Settings sections on the configuration page are now in alphabetic order.
- Settings sections on the configuration page are always collapsed by default.
- Job type was added in mediamosa_statistics_job table.
- Fixed range search for Solr.

  not supplied.
- Fixed: The combination URL and URI in mediafile check when IS_DOWNLOADABLE was
  set to any value in mediafile/create resulted in unnessary exception.
- Added transactions into metadata save and deletion of asset. Although we need
  a more extended transaction support on REST calls; rolling back everything
  during the REST call. This is very tricky; What do we do with any output
  already generated? Watchdog entries will be rolled back too. Need some more
  thinking for the global transaction support.

  admin.
- Fixed problem saving transcode profile without revision saving.

Other changes (not ticket related)
- Play proxy call will now return the ticket id in result.
- Fixed number of query bugs in AUT / ACL code.
- Fixed job server where 2 rows where inserted while only one was allowed.
- Added unique index on mediamosa_job_server table to prevent multiple rows on
  same parent job.
- Added foreign key on mediamosa_job_server to mediamosa_job - job_id.
- Prevented possible divided by zero problems in job server.
- asset_id_root in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is now deprecated, will be
  removed in later versions.
- parent_id in mediamosa_asset table is now deprecated, will be removed in later
  versions.
- is_original_file boolean in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is deprecated, is
  replaced by mediafile_id_source.
- mediafile_id_source is now either NULL or points to its original mediafile.
- Fixed still generation call /mediafile/$mediafile/still.
- Fixed play_restriction code. Typo with 'time_restriction_' prevented working
  of this code in the play proxy code. Seems to be old bug dating back from 1.0.
- Added /version REST call.
- Empty metadata values is no longer allowed. This made the search query a bit
  faster.
- Statistics in 1.x falsely created new statistics based on what some unittest
  was testing. F.e. the CQL unit test would generate new stats based on the
  searches during test and store them as normal stats. This no longer is
  a bug because of the sandbox environment of 2.x unittests.
- Some ffmpeg versions give value 'N/A' for bitrate. This caused database errors
  when trying to insert. Fixed by converting all required numeric values to
  integers.
- Conversion of some queries where NULL was inserted into NON-NULL allowed
  values is creating problems in DP7 database. This is because the old D6 code
  unintentially forced NULL values to be empty strings. This behavor can not be
  replicated in D7. Decided to put those columns in the database to allow NULL
  values instead. Statistics as example had owner_id and group_id as non-null.
- Fixed /collection which had asset_id as required, which is only when the call
  was made as /asset/{asset_id}/collection.
- Removed field 'locked' from asset and asset output(s). Field was not
  documented or used.
- Header fields item_count_total and item_offset are always present in the
  header while in 1.x these only where found for multi item results. In case of
  single item results, then item_count_total will always be 1 and item_offset 0.
- mediafile output will include new mediafile_id_source which can hold the ID of
  the original mediafile. When empty, then the mediafile is a original.
- /asset/$asset_id/joblist [GET] will now return 705 (empty result) when no jobs
  where found, instead of result ID 601 (OK).
- /asset/$asset_id/metadata [POST] will now return 705 (empty result) when no
  metadata was added.
- /asset/$asset_id/still/create [POST] will now return the job_id in the
  items response when success. 1.x only returned a 601 success result ID.
- The 'limit' REST parameter, where used in REST calls, is no longer required in
  any REST call, its default is 200.
- Date types uses ISO8601 norm; 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'.
  Timezone specification in ISO8601 however is ignored for now. Its now allowed
  to enter '2007' or '2007-10' without triggering errors.
- Server IP/URL settings are now prepared/compliant for IPv7.
- MediaMosa is now UTF8 Compliant.
- asset/delete REST call now returns failures per failed asset and their cause.
- Fixed problems editing the transcode profile.
- Fixed migration problem on transcode profiles.
- REST call mediafile/$mediafile_id/uploadticket/create now also returns the
  ticket_id as separate value.
- Removed notices and warnings when mediafile's file on disk does not exists.
- Added new unit test listing under Browse tab.
- Added new development tool/module for testing REST calls.

  root asset. This will make the database more reliable, faster and easier to
  maintain.

  future releases.
