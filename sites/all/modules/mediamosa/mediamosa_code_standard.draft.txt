Draft for starting code standard for MediaMosa 2.x and higher.

- Misc;
  * Use mediamosa_io for IO related functions like mkdir, unlink, etc.
  * All non-drupal hook functions must be inside static classes so they 
    are autoloaded.
  * All class function should have their array's hint typed;
    function foo(array $foo) {
     ...
    }
  * End variable name of array's with s when it contains more than one entity;
    function foo(array $clients) {
      foreach ($clients as $client) {
        ...
      }
    }
  * There is no reason for 99% of the functions to return TRUE / FALSE. We 
    consider functions, when they return all was OK. Anything that goes wrong 
    will cause an exception to be thrown. Exceptions for TRUE / FALSE returns 
    are functions that are not fatal when returning FALSE, f.e. testing exists
    on file.
  * Do not create core functions that enrich a response object, prefer returning
    array and let the REST call function enrich the response with the returned 
    array. Enriching response objects makes the function useless for re-usage
    for code that don't use response objects. In current code there are still 
    some of the code that uses response objects, these will be re-written.

- Database;
  * Always use $result as variable name;
    $result = mediamosa_db::db_query('...');
  * Use the mediamosa_db, do not use drupal db_* functions. These are wrapped in
    our mediamosa_db class.
  * Favor use ON instead of USING() in your JOINs, drupal 7 layer doesn't
    support this in its db_select class,
  * Favor usage of db_query for complex selects instead of db_select.
  * Build aliases of tables with the first letter of each word (skipping 
    mediamosa);
    mediamosa_asset AS a
    mediamosa_asset_mediafile AS amf
    mediamosa_asset_metadata AS amd
    mediamosa_asset_mediafile_metadata AS amfmd
    mediamosa_collection AS c
    mediamosa_collection_asset AS ca
    etc.
  * Stop using db_set_active(), all is in drupal database. Better use an 
    installation in a installation (prefix).
  * All tables must start with 'mediamosa_'
  * Think about indexes on your tables, do not over do it. To many indexes will 
    kill performance.
  * Stop using object() instead of assoc() related functions, prefer arrays over 
    objects. Remember that the mediamosa_db will always return array. This 
    choice is based on 1.x code base. This does not mean there are no objects in 
    mediamosa. 

- Set up folders MediaMosa map;
  * Core modules are not drupal modules and are not considered as drupal 
    modules.
  * Core is one drupal module and should not have dependencies (exception is 
    simpletest and MediaMosa SDK).
  * The folder 'modules' in the mediamosa folder contains all modules that are 
    part of the mediamosa and on top of the core. These are drupal modules and 
    may not contain any core logic.
  * The folder 'core' in the mediamosa folder contains all core code divided by 
    folders per section. Each section can have sub sections, like mediafile has 
    parent asset and does not exist without it. Same for metadata of assets.
    Folders here are setup like database hierarchy dependencies. F.e. mediafile 
    must have a asset, but an asset does not require a collection. That is why 
    collection is on same level as assets.
  * (strongly) Suggested files in core; [subpart/]mediamosa_(part)[_subparts]
    (.inc/.install.inc/_db.inc);
    mediamosa_asset_db.inc (DB definitions)
    mediamosa_asset.inc (asset code)
    mediamosa_asset.install.inc (install code)
    mediafile/mediamosa_asset_mediafile_db.inc (DB definitions)
    mediafile/mediamosa_asset_mediafile.inc (asset code)
    mediafile/mediamosa_asset_mediafile.install.inc (install code)
  * Suggested files in modules; mediamosa_(part)[_subparts]
    (.info/.module/.rest.inc/.test);
    mediamosa_asset.module (Drupal module file)
    mediamosa_asset.rest.inc (REST functions)
    mediamosa_asset.info (Drupal module info file)
